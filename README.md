## General Info
---
---

* The purpose of this site is to make a fun but challanging quiz application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
* I followed multiple tutorials in preperation for this and created this project tutorial as well as others 4 times before having my own shot at it.
* Even though I followed a tutorial I physically typed every single letter of code myself and can now say I have a good understanding of the what/why of the code is and feel I have developed a much better understanding of JavaScript as a whole.
* I genuinely struggled throughout this section of the course but after completing this project over and over again I can say with confidence I am happy with the progression of my JavaScript although a lot of extra work is to be done to be at a level where I could create this app on my own.
* The bulk of the styling is based on a tutorial but I had to customize it with my own media queries as they were not present and added my own flare on the style itself.
* Overall I am extremely comfortable with CSS and HTML, I find them very straightforward and easy to use so I felt.
* The JavaScript tutorial owner is a YouTuber named Brian Design, the vast majority of the code was created and can only be credited to him.

 #### Fonts


#### Color Palette
The color pallete I went with was black background with all blue buttons except for the button leading to the highscores page which is yellow, also the progress bar is a shade of green. The buttons also turn green or red based on the answer being correct or incorrect.

## Testing

* As I read through the code multiple times I am happt to say that there was a total of 1 error through all of the validation which was quickly resolved as a minor typo.
